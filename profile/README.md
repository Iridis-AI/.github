# Iridis AI

**AI lab focused on affordable and accessible AI.**

## ‚ú® About Us

Iridis AI is a AI lab founded by two passionate high school students. We're dedicated to building AI that is not only powerful but also affordable and accessible to everyone. 

## üöÄ What We Do

*   **Fine-tuning diverse language conversational LLMs:** We focus on creating language models that understand and respond effectively in various cultural contexts. Our initial focus is on **Japanese, Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese), English, and Korean**.
*   **Fine-tuning Text-to-Speech (TTS) models:**  We fine-tune TTS systems that deliver optimal performance and cultural relevance, particularly for **Japanese, Chinese (Cantonese) and English**.

### üî≠ Coming Soon

We're expanding into:

*   **LLM(s) from scratch** In the future, where if we have enough data and dedication, we may consider developing new models.
*   **Benchmarks for llms**

## ü§ù Get Involved

We're always looking for collaborators and contributors! If you're passionate about AI and its potential to make a positive impact, we'd love to hear from you.
