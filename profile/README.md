# Iridis AI

**AI lab focused on affordable and fast AI.**

## ‚ú® About Us

Iridis AI is a AI lab founded by two passionate high school students. We're working to finetuning SLMs (Small language models) to make it powerful, while being small enough to run on consumer hardware.

## üöÄ What We Do

*   **Fine-tuning conversational LLMs:** We focus on finetuning language models that understand and respond effectively. Our initial focus is **Chinese (Mandarin & Cantonese, Traditional) And English** for now.
*   **Custom Datasets:** We aim to enhance existing model's perforance via custom datasets, which will be made public in the future.
*   **Fine-tuning Text-to-Speech (TTS) models:**  We fine-tune TTS systems that deliver optimal performance and cultural relevance, particularly for **Japanese, Chinese (Cantonese) and English**.

### üî≠ Soon‚Ñ¢

We're expanding into:

*   **LLM(s) from scratch** In the future, where if we have enough data and dedication (and the compute power to), we may consider developing new models.
*   **Benchmarks for llms**

## ü§ù Get Involved

We're always looking for collaborators and contributors! If you're passionate about AI and its potential to make a positive impact, we'd love to hear from you.
